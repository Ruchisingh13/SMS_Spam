End to end code for the email spam classifier project
Building an SMS spam classifier involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Here's a general outline of how you could go about building one:

Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. You can find such datasets online, or you can create your own by manually labeling messages.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by removing any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and special symbols.
Tokenize the messages into words or phrases.
Convert the text data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This could involve techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text data. This might include:

Word frequency features
Presence or absence of certain keywords or phrases
Length of the message
Presence of numeric digits or special characters
Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model suitable for text classification. Common choices include:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Deep Learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Model Training: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your trained model on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. This could involve techniques like cross-validation and grid search.

Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, deploy it in a real-world application where it can classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam in real-time.
